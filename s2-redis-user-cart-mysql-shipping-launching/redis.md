Redis is used for in-memory data storage(Caching) and allows users to access the data of database over API.

HINT
Versions of the DB Software you will get context from the developer, Meaning we need to check with developer

Redis is offering the repo file as a rpm. Lets install it
yum install https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm -y

Enable Redis 6.2 from package streams.
yum module enable redis:remi-6.2 -y

Install Redis
yum install redis -y

Usually Redis opens the port only to localhost(127.0.0.1), meaning this service can be accessed by the application that is hosted on this server only. However, we need to access this service to be accessed by another server, So we need to change the config accordingly.
Update listen address from 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0 in /etc/redis.conf & /etc/redis/redis.conf

Start & Enable Redis Service
systemctl enable redis
systemctl start redis
