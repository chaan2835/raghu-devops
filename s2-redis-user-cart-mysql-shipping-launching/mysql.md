07-MySQL
Developer has chosen the database MySQL. Hence, we are trying to install it up and configure it.

CentOS-8 Comes with MySQL 8 Version by default, However our application needs MySQL 5.7. So lets disable MySQL 8 version.
yum module disable mysql -y

Setup the MySQL5.7 repo file
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql.repo
    [mysql]
    name=MySQL 5.7 Community Server
    baseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.7-community/el/7/$basearch/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0

Install MySQL Server
yum install mysql-community-server -y

Start MySQL Service
systemctl enable mysqld
systemctl start mysqld

Next, We need to change the default root password in order to start using the database service. Use password RoboShop@1 or any other as per your choice.
mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass RoboShop@1

You can check the new password working or not using the following command in MySQL.
mysql -uroot -pRoboShop@1
